# Generated Rust bindings for [ESP8266 Arduino library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/)

This is part of a work-in-progress experiment to use
[mrustc](https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc)'s Rust to C transpiler to
allow writing firmware for the ESP8266 in Rust. Use at your own risk. Pull
requests welcome.

Requirements for regenerating the bindings with `generate.sh`:

- [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen) CLI
- [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt)
- ESP8266 toolchain installed in [`.platformio`](http://platformio.org/)
